\# 🛡 Advanced Web Security Scanner



An automated web vulnerability scanner built in Python that identifies common web application security issues including \*\*SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), missing security headers, and technology disclosure\*\*.



The project demonstrates how professional security tools perform automated vulnerability discovery through \*\*crawling, payload injection, response analysis, and security reporting\*\*.

\# 📌 Project Overview



Modern web applications are vulnerable to various security issues. Security scanners automate the process of detecting vulnerabilities.



This project implements a \*\*modular web security scanning framework\*\* that performs:



\* Web crawling

\* Parameter discovery

\* Vulnerability scanning

\* Security misconfiguration detection

\* Technology fingerprinting

\* Scan result visualization

\* Automated report generation



The scanner architecture is inspired by tools like:



\* OWASP ZAP

\* Nikto

\* Burp Suite

\# 🚀 Features



✔ Website crawler for endpoint discovery

✔ SQL Injection vulnerability detection

✔ Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) detection

✔ Security header analysis

✔ Web technology detection

✔ Flask dashboard for scan visualization

✔ PDF vulnerability report generation

\# 🔎 Module Explanation



\## 1️⃣ Web Crawler



File:



```

scanner/crawler.py

```



Discovers URLs within the target website by parsing HTML links.



Example output:



```

Scanning: https://example.com

Discovered URL: https://example.com/about

Discovered URL: https://example.com/contact

```



---



\## 2️⃣ SQL Injection Scanner



File:



```

scanner/sqli\_scanner.py

```



Tests parameters using SQL payloads.



Example payloads:



```

' OR '1'='1

' UNION SELECT NULL--

```



The scanner analyzes responses for database error patterns.



---



\## 3️⃣ Cross-Site Scripting Scanner



File:



```

scanner/xss\_scanner.py

```



Injects XSS payloads and checks if they are reflected in the response.



Example payload:



```

<script>alert(1)</script>

```



---



\## 4️⃣ Security Headers Scanner



File:



```

scanner/headers\_check.py

```



Checks for missing security headers:



| Header                    | Purpose               |

| ------------------------- | --------------------- |

| Content-Security-Policy   | Prevents XSS          |

| X-Frame-Options           | Prevents clickjacking |

| Strict-Transport-Security | Enforces HTTPS        |

| X-Content-Type-Options    | Prevents MIME attacks |



---



\## 5️⃣ Technology Detection



File:



```

scanner/tech\_detection.py

```



Identifies server and backend technologies.



Example:



```

Server: cloudflare

Technology: PHP

Framework: Laravel

```



---



\# 📊 Dashboard



File:



```

dashboard/app.py

```



Displays scan results through a web interface.



\## Dashboard



!\[Dashboard](dashboard.png)



Dashboard shows:



\* Target scanned

\* Detected vulnerabilities

\* Security misconfigurations

\* Server technology



Run dashboard:



```

cd dashboard

python app.py

```



Open:



```

http://127.0.0.1:5000

```



---



\# 📄 Security Report



File:



```

reports/report\_generator.py

```



Generates a \*\*PDF vulnerability report\*\* similar to professional security tools.



Example report contents:



\* Target information

\* Vulnerabilities detected

\* Severity level

\* Technology detected



Run report generator:



```

cd reports

python report\_generator.py

```



---



\# ▶ Running the Scanner
